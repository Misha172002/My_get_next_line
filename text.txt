Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. 
If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done after your peer-evaluations. 
If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthoughtâ€™s grading, the evaluation will stop.
